        Hello, my name is Alyssa but you can call me Eliza. I am from Malaysia but I was born in Singapore. I am currently 17 years old. I love to draw and watch loads of cartoons which I'm obsessed with drawing it. I love love Sarbina Carpenter and I draw her as well. My insparations are (they are on instagram) @suchabeautifuldrawing, @sohariaabbsi, the amazing Rebecca Sugar, and of course load more. Besides drawing, I play the viola in my school's top orchestra. I have been playing the viola since I was 12 but I am not very good at it so I draw. Drawing helps me to be calm and happy. My favourite movies are It (2017), The Perks of Being a Wallflower and Geography Club. Some of my favourite cartoons are Steven Universe, Star vs The Forces of Evil and Infinity Train. There's obviously more but I didn't want to list them all. I love all the cartoons I watch. They always make me feel inspired to draw.</p>
